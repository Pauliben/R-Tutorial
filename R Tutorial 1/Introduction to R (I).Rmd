## About me

This course was developed by [Paul Adunola](https://pauliben.github.io/pauladunola.github.io/index.html) from the [blueberry and genomics lab](https://www.blueberrybreeding.com/), University of Florida. It aims to provide beginners with the foundation in utilizing R. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me at **adunolapaul@gmail.com**. Thanks. 

## Introduction to R

### What is R?
 
* R is a free, open source programming language for statistical computing.
* Widely used and user friendly.
* It is more than "just" modelling.
* You can import and export data easily.
* You can clean and wrangle (data wrangling) in R.
* Powerful data visualization and graphics.
* Rich online community.

### R Studio

* It is a development environment that makes using R easier.

*Why RStudio?*
  
* Keeps code, graphics, outfiles in different windows.
* Syntax-highlighting editor.
* R projects/markdown.

**Why program?**

Personally, I used to hate codes but now, I love codes because of R. So, relax! You will learn with constant practice...winks!
  
**So, why program?**

* You can reuse and adapt code.
* You can read code - easy to understand and evaluate.
* You can share code.
* You can automate code.

If you are new to programming, getting started might be difficult. I personally took an online course. I will suggest [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming), [CRAN's R Introduction](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf), or just ask **Google**.

### Installing R and R studio

R can be downloaded on the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/). Download and install the version of R depending on the operating system (Mac, Windows or Linux) of your computer. 

I stongly advise that you use RStudio as a beginner even though some people are against this. To install R studio, follow the instruction on [posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

After successful installation of both software, open RStudio, the interface should be as shown below.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/paul.adunola/Desktop/R Tutorial/RStudio.png")
```

## Getting started

### R as a calculator

Note: "#" is added to R script to make comments or annotate codes.

```{r}
#My first comment. 

2 + 2   #Sum
2 - 2   #Subtraction
2 / 2   #Division
2 ^ 2   #Square
2 ^ 0.5 #Square root

```

### Functions

R offers a wide range of built-in functions to perform various statistical and mathematical operations. Instead of writing code from scratch, you can leverage these functions for efficiency. For instance, the `factorial` function can be utilized to compute factorial values.

**To calculate 5 factorial, that is, 5!**

```{r}
5*4*3*2*1
```
 
Or you can use the function called `factorial()`

```{r}
factorial(5)
```

Other functions you will use frequently:

```{r}

log(10)            #Logarithm
log(10, base = 10) #Logarithm
sqrt(4)            #Square root
exp(6)             #Exponential
seq(from=1, to=10, by=2) #Sequence
rep(x="maize", times=5) #Repetition
paste("I", "love", "R programming", sep = " ") #Concatenation

```

### Getting Help

It's common to encounter functions with multiple arguments, which can be challenging for new R programmers. To gain clarity, it's recommended to explore additional information about the specific function you intend to use.

Moreover, trying to remember all the function names you require is impractical. Seeking help is crucial. You can use the `?` symbol followed by the command you need assistance with, such as `?factorial`. Alternatively, utilizing search engines like **Google** often proves to be a valuable resource in finding the information you need.

```{r}
help("factorial")
?factorial
```

### Objects

Objects are use to store variables for future use. Objects are not case sensitive but avoid starting with a number.

```{r}
x = 2 + 2
x

my_name = "Paul"
my_name

```

The variable in `x` can be reused for future calculations.

```{r}

x * 3
x + x

y = x / 1.5
y

```

Variables in objects can be updated. Such that, the initial variable will be lost.You will notice that `x` is no longer 4 in the example below because it has been updated.

```{r}
x = 3 * 3
x
```

### Vector

A vector is a combination of numeric variables, character variables or combination of both. To create a vector, use `c()`

```{r}

x = c(1,2,3,4,5,6)             #Numeric vector
y = c("A","B","C","A","B","C") #Character vector
x
y

```

Note: It is good to ensure that vectors contain the same data type. This allow the ease of reusing them.

```{r}
str(x)  #Structure of the vector objects
sum(x)  #Sum of the vector objects
mean(x) #Mean of the vector objects
var(x)  #Variance between the vector objects
```

### Logical Operation

Logical operations in R are used to perform comparisons and evaluate conditions, resulting in logical values (TRUE or FALSE). Here are the commonly used logical operations in R:

* Equality: == or isTRUE()
* Inequality: != or isFALSE()
* Greater than: >
* Less than: <
* Greater than or equal to: >=
* Less than or equal to: <=
* Logical AND: & or &&
* Logical OR: | or ||
* Logical NOT: !


```{r}
# Logical operation example
x = 4
y = 10

x < y

#Create a vector z
z = seq(1,20,2) #Create a vector ranging from 1 to 20 by 2
z

w = z > y #Which z is greater than 10
w
class(w)

which(w)    #Identify the position of variables greater than 10 in z
z[which(w)] #Subset variables greater than 10 in z

```

### Data frame

Data frame is a two-dimensional tabular data structure consisting of rows and columns. It is used to store structured data, where each column can contain values of different types (numeric, character, logical, etc.), and each row represents an observation or record.

* Create data frame:

```{r}

df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Paul", "Nancy", "Kenny", "Favour"),
  age = c(31, 28, 32, 27),
  student = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
)
df

```

* Accessing data frame

```{r}

df$name
df[["age"]]
df[,3]
df[c(1,3),c("name","age")]

```

* Performing operations

```{r}

#Filter row
df_new = df[df$age > 30,] #Select rows where individuals' age is greater than 30
df_new

#Add new column - Salary
df$salary = c(33000, 12500, 21000, 5000)
df

#Arithmetic - Mean
average_salary = mean(df$salary)
average_salary

```

### Loops

Loops are control structures used to repeatedly execute a block of code based on a specified condition or a fixed number of iterations. There are several types of loops in R:

* `for`: allows iteration over a sequence (e.g., a vector, list, or sequence of numbers)

```{r}

#Example 1
for (i in 1:5) {
  # Print each iteration
  print(i)
}

#Example 2
#Create a vector z
z = seq(1,20,2) #Create a vector ranging from 1 to 20 by 2
z

length(z) #length function determines the number of variables in a vector
for (i in 1:length(z)) {
  # Print each iteration
  cat(z[i], "is variable", i, "in z vector.","\n") #cat is another function for printing outputs in R.
}

```

* `while`: allows repeated execution a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. 

```{r}
i <- 7
while (i <= 15) {
  # Print output as long as the condition is true
  print(i)
  i <- i + 1
}

```

### Libraries

Libraries are collections of pre-compiled R functions, data sets, and other resources that extend the functionality of the base R system. Libraries, also known as packages, are created by the R community and provide additional tools for various tasks such as data manipulation, statistical analysis, visualization, machine learning, and more.

Before using a library, you need to install it once on your system using the `install.packages()` function. You will need to install some important R packages as shown in the example:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#remove #

#install.packages("readr")    #Install readr package for reading csv files
#install.packages("readxl")   #Install readxl package for reading excel files
#install.packages("dplyr")    #Install dplyr package for wraggling data
#install.packages("ggplot2")  ##Install readr package for visualizing plots

```

Load package: Use `library()` or `require()`


```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#remove #

library("readr")    
library("readxl")   
library("dplyr")   
library("ggplot2")  

```

### Importing data

You can import data from: `csv`, `xls`, `xlsx`, `sav`, `dta`, `por`, `sas` and `stata` files. You can explore more by clicking the "File" menu, followed by the "Import Dataset" submenu on the toolbar. The trickiest part is figuring out how to tell R where to look on your computer to find the file you want. We'll start by finding out where R is looking by default, and create a folder there to put the files we want to read into R.

Firstly, set working directory.
* In RStudio, go to Session -> Set Working Directory -> To Source File Location and select the folder of your file. Or
* Use, `setwd()`

*See mine below*

```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop")
```

* Download the file called `Wheat_Data.xlsx`. Find the attached file.
* After setting working directory, read the datafile in our folder
* Copy the code in the chunk and remove the # in the chunk below and run it. You can play with the data. 

```{r}

#library(readxl)

#Wheat_Data <- read_excel("Wheat_Data.xlsx")
#Wheat_Data = data.frame(Wheat_Data)

#str(Wheat_Data) #Check data structure
#dim(Wheat_Data) #Check data dimension
#head(Wheat_Data) #Cheak data head
#tail(Wheat_Data) #Check data tail
#summary(Wheat_Data) #Check data summary

```

The example above is used to demostrate how to read an excel file into R. You can use several R packages to read in your data. Some of this packages will used in subsequent modules.

## Exercise

### Exercise 1 
Run the following codes:

* c = 14 + 2
* d = 15 * 4

```{r}
# type your code for the Exercise here (c and d), and Knit
c = 64 + 36
d = 15 * 1
```

Find:

* log(c)
* sqrt(d)

### Exercise 2
Let's calculate for mean, median, standard deviation, variance, sum, minimum and maximum values.

* f = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
* g = c(21,23,25,27,30)

`c` is used to concatenate both numeric and string variables.

* mean(f) #Finds the mean
* median(g) #Finds the median
* sd(f)  #Finds the standard deviation
* var(g) #Finds the variance
* min(f) #Finds the minimum value
* max(g) #Finds the maximum value
* sum(f) #Finds the sum
* range(g) #Finds the range (highest and lowest value)

```{r}
# type your code for the Exercise here (e.g. sum(f)), and Knit
f = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)

g = c(21,23,25,27,30)

```

### Exercise 3
Load `Wheat_Data.xlsx` data. Carryout the following:

* Mean of `Plant_biomass` per `Genotypes`
* Are the empty data (`NA`s) in `Foliar_Surface? If yes, how many?
* Aggregate `Yield` by `Genotypes` and `N-incom`
* Does `Blumeria_graminis` increase `Number_of_grain`?


```{r}

#setwd()
#library(readxl)

#Wheat_Data <- read_excel("Wheat_Data.xlsx")
#Wheat_Data = data.frame(Wheat_Data)

```
